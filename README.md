# PWM controller for microscope ringlight

very rough project to make an ATTiny85 powered PWM controller to run 24V ringlight

* MicroscopeLightPCB is a kicad project with schematic and rough board layout.
  * Board was manufactured on protoboard, PCB layout helped for hand routing enamel jumper wire to connect components.
* MicroscopeLightFW is an Arduino IDE project to program the Atmel.
